# News-Website

This portfolio project is a single-page website created using modern front-end technologies (excluding React.js). The site showcases personal or professional accomplishments, skill sets, and selected works, all presented within a seamless, scroll-based user experience.

Tech Stack
Front-End Framework: Vue.js, Angular, Svelte, or Vanilla JavaScript (no React.js)

Styling: CSS3, SCSS, or a framework such as Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap

API Integration: Fetches portfolio data dynamically from a remote REST API

Key Features
One-Page Layout: All essential sections (About, Skills, Projects, Contact) are rendered on a single, continuous web page.

API-Driven Content: Project listings, skills, and contact information are retrieved via real-time API calls, ensuring the portfolio stays up-to-date without manually editing the static site code.

Interactive Elements: Includes smooth scrolling navigation, animated section reveals, and interactive project cards for a modern user experience.

Example User Flow
Landing Section: Brief introduction and links to social profiles.

Skills Section: Displays a dynamically populated list of technical skills obtained by calling an API endpoint.

Projects Section: Showcases individual projects, with each card detailing the title, description, technology stack, and a linkâ€”fetched from the API.

Contact Section: Includes a form that submits user inquiries via an API request.

API Usage
On page load, the site sends a GET request to a portfolio API endpoint (e.g., /api/projects) to retrieve and display project data.

Skills and contact information are similarly fetched from dedicated API routes.

The contact form POSTs submitted data to the API, enabling real-time message delivery.

Benefits
Maintainability: Updating content is as simple as modifying the backend API; no code redeployment is required.

Performance: The single-page architecture ensures fast load times and smooth navigation.

Scalability: Easily accommodates new content sections or features by extending API endpoints or integrating third-party services.
